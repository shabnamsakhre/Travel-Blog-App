        summary: `Look, I love my kid. I love traveling with my kid.

                heading: "🗺️ Chiang Mai: Slower, Greener, and Definitely More Chill Than Bangkok",
                content: `Chiang Mai is like Bangkok’s cooler older sister who went to art school, grew her own herbs, and doesn’t yell at you in traffic. It’s a cultural gem in Northern Thailand—think golden temples, lush mountains, and that famous noodle soup khao soi you’ll dream about for weeks. <br>
                ✈️ Getting there is easy: just an hour flight from Bangkok or fly in directly from regional hubs. <br>
                🚗 Getting around is a breeze too, whether with Grab or a rental car. <br>
                This place is a soft landing for families: safe, spacious, and surrounded by activities that won’t melt your toddler—or your soul.`

                heading: "🌾 What’s the Vibe?",
                content: `This was one of the first Four Seasons in Asia, and after 30 years, she still slays. She’s aged like Diane Keaton—elegant, calm, and slightly smug in the best way. The resort is tucked just outside the city, wrapped in rice paddies and chirping birds, so quiet you’ll swear someone hit “mute” on real life. <br>
                Rooms and villas are woven through the landscape like a village. If you’re lucky, a buffalo might saunter by. Yes, a literal buffalo. <br>
                It’s the kind of place where your toddler giggles at chickens, you sip pandan tea like you’ve always been this serene, and the loudest noise you’ll hear is a frog having a moment.`

                heading: "🛏️ Where We Slept",
                content: `We stayed in a Rice Terrace Pavilion, and it hit every note. Ground floor (toddler-friendly), private little pavilion (mom-quiet-time), and views over the paddies so calming it felt illegal. There’s plenty of space, a big bathtub, and tons of thoughtful storage—aka the holy grail of family hotel design. <br>
                No two rooms here feel generic. It’s all carved wood, beautiful textiles, and little moments of wonder. Our toddler spent forever watching birds from the terrace. I spent forever pretending I didn’t hear “Mama?” while soaking in the tub. <br>
                👉 Need more space? The Garden Pavilions offer more privacy, though a bit further out. <br>
                👉 Have teens or friends in tow? The Residences are beautiful, generous in size, and full of charm. <br>
                👉 Adults-only escape? The Pool Villas are jungle-wrapped, serene, and stunning—but only for ages 12+.`

                heading: "🍴 What We Ate (and Loved)",
                content: `Let’s talk food—because this place does it right. <br>
                I visit Thailand multiple times a year, and I’ve had my fair share of Thai food (street-side, grandma-made, Michelin-starred and everything in between). So believe me when I say: the food at Four Seasons Chiang Mai hit the spot. <br>
                KHAO, the all-day restaurant, serves dishes that are authentic yet elevated. The kind of meals that feel like home-cooking with a PhD. There’s also afternoon tea that rotates seasonally. We caught the pandan coconut cake and strawberry cheesecake moment—and it was divine. On select Sundays? A complimentary tea-time buffet that looks like dessert met a fairy tale. <br>
                NORTH is where you go to feel grown-up again. Open-fire cooking, premium meats, and wide-open views. Pro tip: this is where the mascara comes out. <br>
                👶 Kids under 4 eat free. <br>
                🍰 There’s a kids menu, but honestly? Sharing’s more fun.`

            {
                heading: "Here’s the thing: you don’t need to leave the resort",
                content: `Buffalo Bathing was the highlight—and it’s free. These majestic, gentle creatures walk to greet guests each morning and evening like it’s a red carpet. Bathing them was wholesome, hilarious, and genuinely moving. <br>
                At 5pm each day, the resort hosts a Farmer’s Parade, where the team in traditional dress parade through the paddies—drums, chants, and all. It’s both calming and magical, like a lullaby for the soul. Best spot to watch? Either from the family pool (with a mocktail in hand) or from the comfort of your terrace if you’re staying in a Rice Terrace Pavilion. <br>
                We also tried the tie-dye workshop (chargeable), explored the herb garden, and watched kids squeal over ducks and chickens near the lotus pond. <br>
                There’s no kiddie pool, but both the family pool and adults-only pool are lovely in the afternoon. Poolside perks? Complimentary sunscreen, iced water, and fresh orange slices—a parent’s dream. We also floated in the jacuzzi that is tucked away and offers more privacy. <br>
                🧘‍♀️ Into wellness? There’s spa treatments, prenatal massage, sound healing, and yoga overlooking the rice fields. <br>
                💪 The gym is enormous, fully equipped, and even has a proper Pilates setup.`

                heading: "🎈 Why It’s Great for Kids (and Moms)",
                content: `The Kids Club is beautifully curated with Montessori toys, and they’re in the process of upgrading it even more. Our toddler could’ve lived there. <br>
                And here’s the part that made my pregnant heart melt: when I told the hotel I was 5 months along, they put a maternity pillow in the room. Staff constantly checked if meals were pregnancy-safe. There are prenatal massages, yoga, and thoughtful touches everywhere—from softer bedding to quieter corners. Not many hotels go the extra mile for pregnant women like this one does, and as a mom-to-be, I felt deeply seen. <br>
                At breakfast, there’s a charming little pandan leaf craft station where kids can collect handmade flowers and animals—such a sweet way to keep little hands busy while you sip your coffee. The staff? So many are parents themselves, and it shows. They truly adore children, and it never felt like our toddler’s (very enthusiastic) presence was a burden. <br>
                From baby cots and kids’ toiletries in the room to high chairs and kid-friendly tableware at KHAO, everything felt seamlessly family-ready. And every time our toddler decorated the floor with rice or decided utensils were optional, the staff didn’t flinch—in fact, they praised her for trying to eat on her own. <br>
                Even the airport transfer came with a car seat, pre-installed and ready to go—proof that thoughtful family travel isn’t just a tagline here. It’s built into everything they do.`

                heading: "🧳 Final Thoughts",
                content: `Yes, it’s a little out of town. Yes, it’s worth it. This isn’t just a hotel—it’s a retreat, the kind that makes you slow down, soak it in, and maybe ugly cry at a sunset (again). <br>
                Rates vary by season, starting around THB 22,000/night (~USD 600) in low season (May–September) and climbing higher in peak months (December–February). But the peace of mind? The buffaloes? The cheesecake? Honestly, priceless. <br>
                Book with us through our Four Seasons Preferred Partner program for the best rates, breakfast included, exclusive credits, VIP status, and yes—even a welcome note with your name on it.`
