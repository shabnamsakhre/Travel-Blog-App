Be My Travel Muse - Frontend Remake

üåü Project Overview
This repository hosts a modern and responsive frontend remake of the popular travel blog "Be My Travel Muse" (bemytravelmuse.com). Built entirely with React.js and powered by Vite for a blazing-fast development experience, this project aims to replicate the core aesthetic and user experience while demonstrating best practices in component-based development, leveraging custom components, and modern CSS techniques.

This project focuses solely on the frontend presentation. While it doesn't include a backend, it's designed with extensibility in mind, making it ready to integrate with a future API for dynamic content.
