# Be My Travel Muse - Frontend Remake

## 🌟 Project Overview

This repository hosts a modern and responsive frontend remake of the popular travel blog [Be My Travel Muse](https://www.bemytravelmuse.com). Built entirely with **React.js** and powered by **Vite** for a blazing-fast development experience, this project replicates the core aesthetic and user experience while demonstrating best practices in component-based development, leveraging custom components and modern CSS techniques.

> This project focuses solely on the frontend presentation. While it doesn't include a backend, it's designed with extensibility in mind, making it ready to integrate with a future API for dynamic content.
